AIM AND APPROACH 

The aim of the project is to make a UART Protocol circuit. 

The approach with which i handled the project was to take inputs parallelly and then store them temporarily in PISO 4 bit register. The output was then fed to a multiplexer. The selector of the multiplexer were connected to specific continuous D-pattern so that they take data as 0+databit+1 and continue it. As , this will create a 2sec time, for which we have to hold the 0 and 1 bit because after transmitting 4 bits we want to hold for 1 and 0, I set the shift line again with D-pattern 011110 so it we be in load mode for the 2 seconds. 
After this, the data was sent to SIPO 4 bit register. The register will have data bits after every 4 cycle, 0xxx, b00xx, b1b00x,b3b2b1b00,b3b2b1b0 so I used AND gate, which make all the previous 4 4-bits 0000 and only the 5th bit is send as the final output. The clock for both the PISO AND SIPO register is kept same. 

 
SCOPE OF DEVELOPMENT 

Implementing error detection using parity bit, using counters and comparator and then multiplexing it with start, end and parity bit. 

Instead of using AND gates for filtering of the data bits using multiplexer, which can make the 5th bit travel at a specific path.  

Adding more bits. 


ISSUES ENCOUNTERED AND METHOD OF SOLVING THEM 

Initially, I set the sequence for load/shift as 01111 instead of 011110, ignoring that their were 2 bits wait instead of 1. It produced wrong output.
