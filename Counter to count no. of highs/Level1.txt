AIM AND APPROACH 

The aim of this project is to count the number of active stations, or practically speaking, we had to make a digital counter. The output of the counter(i.e.. number of active station) was then to be displayed on a seven segment display. 

The approach, was to first generate a D-pattern sequence which was send as an input to the 4 bit counter circuit, made using D flip flops. After this, the digital output was fed as an input to the binary to 7 segment display encoder, which was finally connected to the display. 


TESTCASES FAILED 

The circuit, is a 4 bit counter so it can count up to a maximum of 15 and we attached the output to a seven segment encoder. So, when the counter counts something greater than 1001, we will get undefined output from the display. 


SCOPE OF DEVELOPMENT 

The seven segment display can be cascaded for displaying more than 9 highs. Though the test sequence (i.e. 0111 1010 0101 1010) had only 9 bits which were high, so only 1 display was enough in this case. 


ISSUES ENCOUNTERED AND METHODS OF SOLVING

Initially I tried to make the circuit using a counter IC, with a seven segment encoder for common cathode display. This configuration was not working even after several tries, because the ground was not set common.
